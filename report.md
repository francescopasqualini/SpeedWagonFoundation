# SE 2 Project
This is the report of Software Engeneering 2. Here you can find the information about
the role division, the problem found and the cause of that userstories.

## Our project
Our project consists about API creation of a gym application helping the users to perform
them exercises, to complete the assigned tasks and to watch them history (each user can
watch just its exercises/tasks/history).
The innovation performed by this application over the concurrency applications is the 
chats with the personal trainer.
Indeed, performing an application benchmarcking on Google Play Store and on the App Store
of Apple, there aren't apps with this plus.

## The implemented userstories
The usersories of our app are the following:

### User Story 1 (Jacopo Sitran) - BTFB: 4.26
* Nome/Descrizione: Costumer information - The app administator can add, delete, modify and read all information the users' information.

This user story perform the managing of the users. The useful of this is trivial.

### User story 2 (luca Staboli) - BFTB: 2.62
* Nome/Descrizione: Training tasks section - The athlete watch his tasks powered by the personal trainer. The PT can add tasks to athlete

This user story perform the managing of the tasks for the athlete. This is very useful (but not like user's managing) because the PT can
add, remove, modify the athlete's programs using an app.

### User story 3 (Alessio Valenza) - BFTB: 2.61
* Nome/Descrizione: Athlete can chat with PT asking about hint - The athelete watch the food's hints and the life style provided by PT.

This user story perform the managing of the chat with a PT. This is a good point for our app because many like this doesn't have this feature.
E.g. An athlete can question to his personal trainer for information about foods

### User Story 4 (Francesco Pavanello) - BTFB: 2.20
* Nome/Descrizione: Gym information - Watch time of a gym, of a course or instructors' names

This user story perform the managing of gyms' information.

### User story 5 (Francesco Pasqualini) - BFTB: 1.00
* Nome/Descrizione: Insert of tasks' history - The athlete instert his exercises or tasks and it can view his improvements

This user story is useful to an athelete to monitor his improvements.


## Problems
The main problem was the JSON policy messages.
Other few problem about the yaml format and the use of swagger 2.0 instead of 3.0 (Some feature are not perfomed by previous version).


## Scheduling
We take one week to choose the project and to do the user stories.
Another week is taken for progrmming the API.
We used the last few days of the second week to merge the APIs and to develop the documentation.
